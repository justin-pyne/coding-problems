# Coding Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to various LeetCode problems in both Python (data structure/algorithm problems) and SQL. The solutions are organized into folders according to the language used.

## Repository Structure
Inside the `python` and `SQL` folders, you will find files for each problem. The naming convention used for these files is as follows:

(problem name) _ (tool used) _ (problem number).py/sql


For example, the TwoSum problem solution using dictionaries in Python is named `twoSum_Dict_1.py`.

## Naming Convention

- `problem name`: The name of the LeetCode problem (e.g., twoSum)
- `tool used`: The primary data structure or algorithm used to solve the problem (e.g., Dict for dictionaries).
- `problem number`: The LeetCode problem number (e.g., 1 for the TwoSum problem)
